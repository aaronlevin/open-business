# Artist Background

To Whom It May Concern:

I am an Edmonton-based folk musician and songwriter. In addition, I run a small folk record label called Cabin Songs (cabinsongs.com). I am very active in the Edmonton music scene, and have recently begun gathering national attention on college radio, and touring to support my music.

## Recent Accomplishments

“Violence” gained significant attention on college radio. It reached [#1 on CJSR’s Top 30 chart](http://www.earshot-online.com/charts/cjsr.cfm?dWeekOfID=2012-10-23), and reached #1 on the national [Folk/Roots/Blues chart](http://www.earshot-online.com/charts/index.cfm?intChartTypeID=107&dWeekOfID=2013-01-08).

Violence was included in several best-of-the-year lists, including [Herohill](http://www.herohill.com/2012/11/reviews-tyler-butler-violence.htm), [Wake the Deaf](http://wakethedeaf.co.uk/post/38942099780/wake-the-deafs-top-15-eps-of-2012) and [Hi54LoFi](http://hi54lofi.com/blog/my-5-favourite-eps-of-2012).   

Recent touring in support of “Violence” includes dates in Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, Victoria, Calgary and Edmonton.
