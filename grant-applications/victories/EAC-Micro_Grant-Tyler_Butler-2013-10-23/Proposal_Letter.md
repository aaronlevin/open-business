Proposal Letter

To Whom It May Concern:

I am applying for a microgrant totalling $302.40. This money will fund a reprint my CD “Violence,” originally released October 20, 2013.

Violence can be heard in its entirety here: [http://tylerbutler.bandcamp.com/album/violence](http://tylerbutler.bandcamp.com/album/violence). 

The requested amount is the total cost of printing 100 copies of the CD at Gateway Press, an Edmonton-based shop that I have worked exclusively with in the past. The grant will be instrumental in helping me meet the persistent 

## Anticipated Costs

**Cost-Per-Unit**: $2.88  
**Number of Units**: 100  
**Cost**: $288  
**GST**: $14.40  
**Total**: $302.40

Because this is a repritn, there is no setup fee included.

## Revenue Sources

There are two different prices for my CDs: online and in-person, usually at shows. I will estimate a 50% split between the two sales. This estimate demonstrates the ability for the product to recuperate the costs, and produce a profit. 

### Online Sales

**Price**: $8.00  
**Est. Number of Sales**: 50  
**Est. Revenue**: $400.00

### In-Person Sales

**Price**: $10.00  
**Est. Number of Sales**: 50  
**Est. Revenue**: $500.00

### Total Revenue

**$900.00**

## Additional Benefits

CDs are invaluable at shows, especially on tour. They are a physical memento of my act, and help cement lasting relationships between myself and my fans. It will be very important to have CDs  on upcoming tours, including a showcase appearance at NXNE in June 2013 (detailed in the Background document)
