# FACTOR: Collective Initiatives - Marketing of Canadian Music on Digital Platforms

## Wyrd Arts Initiatives - Project Proposal

February 14, 2013

Wyrd Arts Initiatives seeks FACTOR support for Marketing of Canadian Music on Digital Platforms (CDM component) to establish the Weird Canada Online Store (WCS). The WCS would serve as a consolidated pathway to deliver physical media (CDs, apparel, vinyl, and other merchandise) and digital downloads of under-represented Canadian artists to a growing online audience. The WCS would also enable easy distribution of physical media to independent record stores across Canada.

### About Us

WeirdCanada.com was developed out of a desire to encourage, document and connect emerging trends in Do-It-Yourself (DIY) music across Canada. Before Weird Canada was founded in 2009, these communities were limited to small, isolated, localized circles of artists and fans. Weird Canada created a centralized online community space for the exploration and discovery of independent and experimental artists across Canada.

To further realize our vision of increased exposure for these artists, Weird Canada began coordinating live music events. The first was Wyrd Festival, a touring concert series, launched in Western Canada in 2009. By 2011, we had partnered with national music events such as NXNE, Obey Convention, The Halifax Pop Explosion, Pop Montreal, and Sled Island, while also coordinating a wide range of independent events throughout the year.  

Voted Best Canadian Music Site by CBC Radio 3 in 2011, WeirdCanada.com is an authoritative curator of Canadian music, and the first outlet to discover a number of breakout Canadian artists including Grimes (Montreal), Purity Ring (Edmonton/Montreal), Rich Aucoin (Halifax), Dirty Beaches (Vancouver), Mac DeMarco (Edmonton), Yamantaka // Sonic Titan (Montreal), and BRAIDS (Calgary/Montreal). Over the past four years, we have written about 700 unique Canadian musicians from every province and territory in over 1200 online posts. 

Weird Canada is an advocate of cultural enthusiasm; we intentionally avoid assigning numerical scores or ranks in featured reviews. We are genre inclusive; our ethic is egalitarian. We are commited to establishing dialogue within artistic communities nationwide and we regularly solicit the opinions of our audience through the WeirdCanada.com forum, monthly newsletter, and our emerging dialogue series: Wyrd the Gathering.  

Incorporated as a not-for-profit in 2012, Wyrd Arts Initiatives (WAI) emerged out of the Weird Canada community in response to a growing need for resources. Weird Canada has established itself as a curatorial presence with extensive creative and geographical reach, and WAI is focused on building resources for our growing community. We seek to enable the distribution of digital and physical media to serve Canada’s DIY music communities and beyond.

### The Problem

> The number one request we get at Weird Canada is ‘where can I buy this?’ Often, we have no idea.” 
> - Paul Lawton, Digital Strategist

Few emerging Canadian artists or labels have the necessary business acumen, marketing guile, and social savvy to effectively market and sell their music, leaving a great majority of Canadian talent unknown to a larger audience. Canadian musicians are scattered across the country, connected only by new online curators and scattered but avid fans.

Meanwhile, fans of independent Canadian music are seeking new ways to support emerging musical currents, but face many pragmatic barriers along the way: Does the musician have a website? Is the shipping cost worth the investment? Will the artist actually send the order? Will it be packaged securely? 

The main source for purchasing tangible media (vinyl, CDs, cassettes) is record stores. Lacking a centralized distributor for independent Canadian music, record stores typically resist stocking short-run independent releases because it is neither financially nor logistically viable. This is especially important given the recent closure of independent Canadian music distributors such as Scratch Music in Vancouver.

The problem of selling, purchasing, and distributing independent music is old, but the magnitude has increased. The internet has made previously scarce information about DIY music widely available to new Canadian consumers, resulting in digital information overload and causing fans to turn to curators like Weird Canada to discover new music. 
 
As a curatorial force, Weird Canada points the way to musical discovery, but is currently unable to connect audiences with a path to purchase music and merchandise. As internet-based audiences adjust purchasing practices to meet the changing landscape of music distribution and consumption, a peer-to-artist economy is struggling to emerge and support the huge tier of musicians between the underground and major labels. Without a proper bridge between artists and consumers, this rising interest and desire for the new wave of independent music is met with an equal loss in opportunities.

### Our Solution: The Weird Canada Store 

We are proposing a new model for music dissemination in Canada by creating a web-store and distribution platform that will act as a bridge between Canadian artists and consumers. All parties, including artists, labels, consumers, and independent record stores, would benefit from a single source developed to bridge musical content from creation to purchase. 

FACTOR support would enable WAI to establish the Weird Canada Online Store (WCS), the first of its kind in Canada. The WCS would serve as a consolidated pathway to deliver physical media and digital downloads of under-represented Canadian artists to Weird Canada’s growing online audience. The WCS would also enable easy distribution of physical media to independent record stores across Canada.

With over 20,000 monthly visits from across Canada, the successful online reach of WeirdCanada.com is evidence that emerging Canadian artists have a large and geographically-disparate fanbase. Weird Canada appeals to a young, University educated, technologically literate group of music fans aged 18-34 [Alexa.com]. This audience desires to discover, support and purchase music: before it’s been signed to a major label or made widely available. 

We’re appealing to our audience to create a distribution platform that truly suits their needs. Even in the planning stage we have actively sought feedback through our monthly newsletter and our social media platforms, thereby ensuring the democratization of our culture and representing a wide range of musicians and geographies. 

The platform we are proposing would simplify and consolidate the process of music distribution, and create a single online marketplace for Canadian independent and experimental music. This endeavour is an extension of Wyrd Arts Initiatives’ central mandate to encourage, document, and connect creative expression across Canada. 

### The Weird Canada Store Components

#### 1) Consumer-facing web-store

The main component of the WCS is a web-store that will make the digital downloads and physical media (CDs, apparel, vinyl, and other merchandise) of independent Canadian artists widely available. The platform will be cleanly designed, user-friendly, artist-oriented, and Search Engine optimized to combine the ease of digital dissemination with the desire to own physical media. The store will be built on the shopify.ca platform, Canada’s leading Ecommerce provider, allowing the store to develop into spaces such as mobile and tablet as the needs of our audience develop.

Customers of the web-store will not only be individual consumers, but also record stores. Our stock will allow individual fans to purchase single (or multiple) items; while record stores may purchase custom packages with multiple products at a wholesale discount.

#### 2) Artist-facing Data Portal

The second component of the WCS is a user-friendly, artist-facing interface that will provide advanced business intelligence for artists. By providing a data-driven narrative, this interface will better connect artists and labels with their new, expanding markets allowing them to make better decisions regarding things such as tour itineraries and promotional spends.  Additionally, they will have access to up-to-date information on sales and monetary balance. 

#### 3) Administration Tools

The third component of the WCS will be a web-based interface which will assist and automate the administrative aspects of our business including, but not limited to: inventory analysis, label printing, product creation and management, and business financials. This interface will provide scalability, a key factor for success when working with volunteers, and a systemization of our practices, thus ensuring that our customers, artists, and labels receive the best possible service. 

### Project Management

Executive Director Marie Flanagan, a professional in Social Enterprise Management and Communications, will oversee the administration and implementation of the project with the assistance of 50+ volunteers in every province across Canada; technical leadership will be provided by professional Software Engineer Aaron Levin, MSc. The WCS marketing plan will begin in September 2013, managed by Paul Lawton, PhD (ABD).

### Technical Overview

Our Web-Store will be built using the Shopify.ca platform. The corresponding Data Portal and Administrative Tools will be developed by experienced contractor Philip Davis between September 2013 and April 2014, built using Open Source tools (Scala programming language, Lift Web Framework, PostgreSQL Database, Redis In-Memory Database, Ubuntu 12.04 Operating System) and hosted in the Amazon Cloud on EC2 instances. The Data Portal will pull data from Shopify.ca and allow authenticated users to view up-to-date, interactive Sales data. The Administrative Tools will allow authenticated admins to request inventory checks, print shipping labels, and access high-level business intelligence (sales, profit margins, quantities, and opportunities). The User Interface and User Experience will be handled by Flume Studios, an established design company catering to the non-profit sector. 

### Consignment Model

Our consignment model is simple and based off a PaaS model: Artists consign their material with us, we provide a trusted interface for them to access data regarding their sales, and in exchange we charge a $1-2 fee for each sale of physical media and full digital albums, and 10% for the sale of Digital singles. This provides an easy-to-understand, transparent profit model for artists, labels and customers. 

### Submission Criteria

The criteria for inclusion in the WCS will be similar to Weird Canada’s submission process:

- Artist must be Canadian
- Release must be: self-released or on a micro/small/independent label.
- Artist’s work must not promote hate speech or discrimination.

While the above will ensure the releases we carry align with WAI’s values and represents a large ecosystem of music in Canada, the following subjective criteria will be considered a priority for the WCS: 

- Experimental and emerging genres
- Releases from remote and/or rural areas. 
- Experimental music from First Nations, Inuit, Metis, Francophone, and other minorities. 
- Self/Home/DIY-recorded music

To assist with the application process we will create a simple, multi-lingual application form.

### Financial Growth

Since 2009, Weird Canada has seen a 500% increase in traffic, averaging around 100,000 unique visitors per year. Through our marketing efforts, in our first year we aim to convert 5% of Weird Canada’s site traffic into physical media customers and with matched digital media sales. This amounts to 5,000 customers purchasing at least one item, equating to at least $5,000 in physical media sales. Matched with digital sales, we expect $10,000 in revenue in our first year.

Through sustained social marketing in the first and second year of operation and increased growth in Weird Canada’s traffic, we expect over 10,000 customers in our second year, purchasing at least 10,000 products in addition to 15,000 digital sales. This will more than double our revenue and present several opportunities for increased growth through marketing. 

### Sustainability

Initial FACTOR funding will pay for the development of our system. Once running, our maintenence fees will be very low thanks to the PaaS model of Shopify.ca and the Amazon Computing Cloud ($3,250 total per annum). Low overhead will allow us to sustainable profits in our first year. Furthermore, WAI provides significant national volunteer resources to assist with marketing and maintenance. 

### Visibility Growth

Organic and social marketing has been the hallmark of Weird Canada’s success. Therefore, our biggest opportunity for visibility growth outside of Weird Canada is in partnering with retail stores across Canada to help stock and curate specialized Canadian content. This will provide a cost-effective path into retail and will heighten the nation-wide scope of our project. 

### Warehousing

The Weird Canada offices have enough space to house approximately 10,000 items. We have additional storage space in Guelph through a partnership with CFRU Station Manager Peter Bradley.

### Expected Outcomes of the Weird Canada Store

The WCS will create a crucial bridge between emerging artists and labels and their new online audiences. By removing the barriers that artists, labels, record stores and consumers face in reaching each other, the WCS will foster nationwide connections and expand the market reach of artists across the country. The WCS will invigorate and empower consumers to better discover and support emerging Canadian music.  As a supplier to record stores, the WCS will allow brick-and-mortar vendors an opportunity to increase their profits and make independent Canadian music available to their customers. The Weird Canada Store will create significant financial resources and support for these emerging artists and labels while developing new markets, greater visibility, and strengthening the nationwide community WAI has been integral in creating. 

For Artists and Labels we expect: increased revenue from physical and digital media sales, increased revenue from multi-purchase discounting, increased exposure by association with the Weird Canada Store, heightened creative abilities from the lessened burden of administration, greater business insight from the Data Portal, and increased consumer awareness and nationwide presence from the distribution of physical media.

For Consumers we expect: increased awareness of physical media from independent artists, increased purchasing of physical media due to ease and quality of experience, and greater connectedness to the independent Canadian music community.

For Record Stores we expect: increased stock of independent Canadian music, increased profit from the sales of independent Canadian music, greater variety of independent Canadian music, increased profit margins for Record Stores from using a single distribution source, and increased customer satisfaction from the availability of previously difficult-to-find music. 

Canadians have identified Weird Canada as a means of musical discovery and an authority on new and emerging music from every province and territory. As curators at the unique point of discovery with 100,000 unique online visitors per year, a strong social media presence, and nationwide live music events, we are optimally positioned to connect artists with consumers. With the WCS in place,  the consumer-facing web-store, distribution service, and data portal will provide a necessary alternative to the non-existent methods of distribution and act as an important feeding point for the upwards mobility of Canadian artists through increased exposure and sales.
