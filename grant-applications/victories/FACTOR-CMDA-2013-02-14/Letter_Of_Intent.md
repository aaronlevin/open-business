Dear Factor Staﬀ,

Please accept this letter of intent as a formal outlining of the objectives of Wyrd Arts Initiatives in regards to the February 14th, 2013 application of the FACTOR Collective Initiatives funding. 

Wyrd Arts Initiatives is an emerging collective that exists to encourage, document and connect creative expression across Canada through multi-genre promotion of emerging and established artists on WeirdCanada.com and at showcases nationwide. Voted Best Canadian music site by CBC Radio 3, WeirdCanada.com is an authoritative curator of Canadian music, and is now in the position to establish a direct path between Canadian artists and new, eager, online audiences. Through web-based consignment with musicians and small-scale record labels, we seek to develop a path-to-purchase web store to respond to the need for a single online marketplace for Canadian independent and experimental music. 

We seek your support in establishing a digital infrastructure for an online marketplace where Canadian experimental and independent musicians can sell their merchandise. Independent Canadian artists have very few avenues outside of physical performances for self-promotion, which leaves the majority of Canadian talent unexplored by a larger and inherently supportive audience. These artists are scattered throughout Canada with neither the organizational abilities, capital investments, nor marketing guile to reach a broader demographic. The platform we are proposing would simplify and consolidate the process of music distribution,while encouraging exploration and musical discovery. 

We are acutely aware that FACTOR does not fund the physical storage of distributed goods. The receipt of the Marketing of Canadian Music on Digital Platforms (CDM component) funding would enable Weird Canada to establish an e-distro platform and online store. Weird Canada would then have the ability to make widely available the digital downloads and physical media (cassettes, CDs, apparel, vinyl) of under represented Canadian Artists, an extension of the centralized vision of WeirdCanada.com. 

As the Executive Director of Wyrd Arts, I would oversee the use of CDM funding from FACTOR to cover the cost of working with web developers to design an accessible, artist-oriented and user-friendly e-distro platform. Since its establishment, Weird Canada has relied exclusively on the volunteer hours of impassioned writers, musicians and artists to sucessfully and consistently feature original Canadian content, while also creating showcase opportunities in diverse communities across Canada. This platform is the ﬁrst initiative that we seek to develop, as Wyrd Arts Initiatives now moves to expand and meet the needs of our growing audience and community. 

Weird Canada has proven its ability to discover, positively represent, and support independent and experimental artists, while simultaneously channeling their creations to untapped audiences across Canada. Introducing a path-to-purchase for these artists will introduce new and signiﬁcant ﬁnancial and emotional resources to these artists. Accessibility to an online store is the next step in facilitating the reinforcement of supportive artistic relationships and will also continue to strengthen the nation-wide community Weird Canada has been integral in creating.

Thank you for your consideration,

Marie LeBlanc Flanagan
