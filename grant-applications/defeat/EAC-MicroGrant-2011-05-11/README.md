# Edmonton Arts Council - 2011 Community Investment Program: MicroGrant Application

The Edmonton Arts Council setup a really cool grant program called [MicroGrant](http://grants.edmontonarts.ca/eac_grants_-_grants_and_awards_for_individual_artists/microgrant_program/). The idea was to provide funding for small projects or "last-minute" funding for larger projects. This was in recognition of the fact that often "thing" or "ideas" come up at the last minute. We were really supportive of this idea.

During Wyrd III we had a number of issues that impacted our available funds for the festival. For example, out of nowhere one of the venues required us to get insurance. This cost us an additional $300. We figured the MicroGrant system would have been perfect for us. Unfortunately, we were denied.

Their main point of contention was the blurry line between "curator", "artist", and "presenter." These blurry and subjective categories are a plague for accessibility to grants. We live in a world that is constantly changing and granting agencies keep trying to put unique organizations in tiny boxes so they can fund them appropriately. 

In any case, we didn't get the grant. Nevertheless, we feel that it was a great application!
